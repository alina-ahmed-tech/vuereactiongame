# vue-reaction-timer
This is a project I built in Vue3 using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
It is a simple game in which you:
1. Click the Start Game button
2. Click the purple box that will appear on screen in a random number of seconds as fast as you can
3. You will get your reaction time displayed on screen.
